# Image Engine Web application

To run this app, I used API from unsplash.com

Main link to fetch data from API is used:
https://api.unsplash.com/search/photos?page=${page}&query=${keyword}&client_id=${accessKey}&per_page=12

Where:
page is number of page fetched
keyword is word on which we query our request to API - image category
accessKey is token ID
